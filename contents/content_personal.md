### Hobby

#### The game of go 
![An excerpt from a famous play between Cho Hun-Hyun and Nie Weiping](images/go.resized.png)
I guess it is the best board game you could ever think of, although I don't know much about other board games. Here're the aspects that I like. 
* At every point of a play, it requires you to think in many modes of thoughts : extensive local *readings*, value judgement on both local and global level, strategic design of the future story of the play, and last but not least, the micro-psychological warfare. 
* Lots of degrees of freedom. 
* Each game has its dramatic story. 
* Lots of discussions about which shapes are the best are still going on, accelerated by the recent development of super-pro-level AI systems.  

I learned it for about three years when I was very young, and made it a hobby when I became older. Now I seldom play it since I am busy, but I sometimes watch youtube lectures on it.

#### Listening to podcasts

I listen to podcasts to learn English while having fun. I have carefully selected what to listen, and think they are all really good.  
* *The Skeptics Guide to the Universe*
* *Freakonomics Radio*
* *The 80,000 Hours Podcast*

### Learning materials recommendation 
<hr/>
This is the list of learning materials that I felt particularly impressive in either their insights or clarity of presentation.  


#### Mathematics 
*  ***Additive Combinatorics*** by Terence Tao and Van Vu

All different approaches of additive combinatorics with deliberate efforts to make connections between them. Many instructive excercise problems. You can learn many other disciplines of mathematics on the way.  
* Professor Sangil Oum's video lecture series on graph theory. 

A comprehensive overview of basic (structural) graph theory, with extra topics like well-quasi-order and matroid theory. The presentation is really fluent. 

#### Computer Science  

* ***Causality*** by Judea Pearl

Before reading this, the concept of *causal relation* always confused me. I just didn't know how to make sense of it, beside things like "change one variable at a time and see the effect". This book teaches you how to construct a model about (a fragment of) the world which is not only statistical but also *causal*, and related theoretical and practical issues.  

#### programming
* ***windows system programming*** by Seong-woo Yoon

I learned the basics of computer systems from this book. Very good as a quick introduction for those who know nothing about computer systems.
