#### pixelworld 

![pixelworld1](images/pixelworld1.resized.png)
![pixelworld2](images/pixelworld2.resized.png)
A virtual ecosystem that (meant to) includes animals, plants, intelligence, and evolution. ([pixelworld](https://github.com/daeseoklee/pixelworld))
A technical specification of the ecosystem can be found here.([here](https://github.com/daeseoklee/pixelworld/blob/master/_docs/pixelworld.pdf)) The prototype was developed in golang. Unfortunately, the intelligence part seemed not to work as intended. 

##### Todo
* If anyone is interested in this kind of thing, I would be happy if you build on top of my design, since I spent a good amount of effort on it.

#### miniworld
A simplified and modified version of *pixelworld*, written in python and cython.([miniworld](https://github.com/daeseoklee/miniworld)) Here's a quantitative quasi-scientific argument that the intelligence part did work as intended.([here](https://github.com/daeseoklee/miniworld/blob/master/docs/draft.pdf))


#### hexago 
![hexago](images/hexago.resized.png)
The go game played on the hexagonal board.([hexago](https://github.com/daeseoklee/hexago)).


##### Todo 
* Make an easy interface to quickly generate the go game with a custom board(an arbitrary simple planar graph)
* Make a website where people can play this game.
