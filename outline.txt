*books and podcasts that I like 
<books>
-Causality by Judea Pearl
[image 2 - book cover]
You can learn how seemingly ill-defined expressions like 'causal effect' or 'had it been A, it would have been B~' can be explained under a coherent model, and how those views can be applied in practice. 
-handbook of practical logic and automated reasoning  by John Harrison
[image 3 - book cover]
-the probabilistic method by Noga Alon and Joel Spencer
[image 4 - book cover] 
A brilliant tale of interplay between discrete mathematics and probability theory, which was originated from Paul Erdos. 
-economic development by Michael P Todaro
[image 5 - book cover]

<podcasts>
-SGU
An enjoyable source for keeping up with new scientific discoveries. 
-freakonomics radio 
-the 80000 hours podcast 
Interesting stories from those who lives up to the principle of effective altruism (See www.effectivealtruism.org). 


*miscallaneous projects
-pixelworld
A virtual ecosystem that (meant to) include animals, plants, intelligence, and evolution.  
A draft of a technical specification can be found here. 
 (***)

A prototype was developed in golang. 
Unfortunately, the intelligence part seemed not to work as intended.

Here's a simplified version, written in python and cython.

A quantitative argument that the intelligence part did work as intended.
